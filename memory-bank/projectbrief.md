# Project Brief

## Purpose
Build a web-based, high-fidelity 3D anatomy visualizer for education and clinical reference. Core emphasis: cranial nerves visualization and interactive cutaneous territory marking on anatomically accurate human models.

## Phase 1 Goal (POC)
Demonstrate a reliable asset-to-browser pipeline that loads and displays a 3D anatomy model with orbit/pan/zoom in a controlled dev environment.

## Success Criteria (Phase 1)
- Serve a web page from the dev environment.
- Load and display an anatomy model.
- Enable orbit, pan, and zoom via Three.js OrbitControls.

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Nerve isolation mode.
- Cutaneous painting.
- State sharing.
- Custom UI.

## Target Users
- Medical & dental students, clinicians, and anatomy enthusiasts.
