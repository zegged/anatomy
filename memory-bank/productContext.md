# Product Context

## Why this exists
Learning and teaching neuroanatomy is complex. A precise, interactive 3D tool helps users understand spatial relationships and nerve pathways.

## What it should do (high-level)
- Display anatomically accurate 3D models.
- Let users explore (orbit, pan, zoom) and later selectively reveal structures (e.g., nerves).
- Eventually support interactive skin (cutaneous) marking and shareable states.

## Current focus
Validate that our web stack loads real anatomy assets reliably and performs adequately on the web.

## UX goals (later phases)
- Minimal friction: fast loading, smooth controls, clear structure lists.
- Accurate visuals with intuitive isolation/visibility controls.
- Simple marking tools with undo/clear and sharable links.
